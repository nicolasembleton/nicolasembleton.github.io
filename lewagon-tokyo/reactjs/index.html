						ReactJS 1/4 - The basics
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### What is React?

						Built by Facebook as a result of their tiredness with framework wars and inefficiencies

						They started to build something that they wanted to be easy to maintain
						regardless of the codebase size and the team size.

						Let's have a quick look at their GitHub: [React@GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react)
						And Google Trends: [Compare framework popularity](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=EmberJS,%2Fm%2F0j45p7w,%2Fm%2F012l1vxv,AureliaJS%20%2B%20aurelia)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It is mostly designed to be:
						- Very fast, even with large amount of components on the screen
						- Embracing the component paradigm as much as possible and increasing atomicity of components
						- Concise and readable (Having everything in one file, JS, HTML and Styling)
						- Highly testable
						- Highly portable (ReactNative and Server-side rendering are good examples)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### Is it that fast?

						React was the first real framework to use a technic called "Virtual DOM".
						Virtual DOM is a technic that allows the page to render the visual layers and
						modify them in an "in-memory" version of the DOM, swapping the real and virtual
						DOM pieces that were modified once finished.
						DOM being a very time-consuming process, enabling this allows for
						"much" faster renderings because it avoids all the reflows.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### What it is not?

						React is "not" a full-fledged framework. Many features aren't available in the
						core library.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### The ecosystem

						One of the main advantage of React is its ecosystem. It is massive and extremist.

						Many many awesome features and libraries have been built around React. For example:
						- Flux; A data-flow library that allows building fluid UI with ease
						- immutable.js; An "immutable" data library to increase predictability to your states
						- Flow; A static type checker for JavaScript
						- ReactNative; Build mobile applications directly in ReactJS
						- MANY more.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### The competition

						As any JS framework the competition is really vast. Angular2, VueJS, AureliaJS,
						EmberJS, and about 2 or 3 dozen others...
					</section>
					<!-- <section data-markdown>
						#### Is it the best framework?

						Thanks for asking. Any JS-war extremist will fight to have others admit their
						framework is the best. But is it really? What is "best", is "best" the same to
						everyone?

						Answer's no. Of course. Every framework has its own strengths and weaknesses.

						ReactJS 2/4 - A first taste
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						First let's look at what is life "without" React:

						[Random CodePen](https://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/hutrb)
					</section>
					<section>
						Here's what life looks "with" React:
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						The smallest component you can do:
						```
							var Hello = React.createClass({
								render: function() {
									return &lt;div>Hello guys&lt;/div>;
								}
							});
						```
						Render it with:
						```
							React.render(&lt;Hello />, document.body);
						```

						[Live example](http://jsbin.com/veluka/1/edit?html,js,output)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Adding a prop (immutable):
						```
							var Hello = React.createClass({
								render: function() {
									return &lt;div>Hello {this.props.name}&lt;/div>;
								}
							});
						```
						Render:
						```
							React.render(&lt;Hello name="Boris" />, document.body);
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Adding state:
						```
							var Hello = React.createClass({
								getInitialState: function() {
									return { activated: false };
								},
								render: function() {
									var divClasses = classNames({
										'activated': this.state.activated
									});
									return &lt;div className={divClasses}>
										Hello {this.props.name}
									&lt;/div>;
								}
							});
						```
						Render:
						```
							React.render(&lt;Hello name="Boris" />, document.body);
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Adding events:
						```
							var Hello = React.createClass({
								getInitialState: function() {
									return { activated: false };
								},
								render: function() {
									var divClasses = classNames({
										'activated': this.state.activated
									});
									return &lt;div onClick={this.activate}
										className={divClasses}>
										Hello {this.props.name}
									&lt;/div>;
								},
								activate: function() {
									this.setState({ activated: true });
								}
							});
						```

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Combining components
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### List Item pattern

						First component:
						```
							var PostListItem = React.createClass({
								render: function() {
								return &lt;div>
									&lt;h3>{this.props.post.title}&lt;/h3>
									&lt;p>{this.props.post.content}&lt;/p>
								&lt;/div>
							}
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Second component:
						```
							var PostList = React.createClass({
								render: function() {
									return &lt;div> {
										this.props.posts.map(function(post) {
											return &lt;PostListItem post={post} />; })
										}
										&lt;/div>;
								}
							 });
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Building the list:
						```
							var posts = [
								{ title: "The first post", content: "lorem ipsum" },
								{ title: "The second post", content: "other lorem" }
							];
							React.render(&lt;PostList posts={posts} />, document.body);
						```

						React 3/4 - Use Cases
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						It's very important to understand a few things before jumping in
						the front-end world.

						1. There is no such thing as "one fits all". The right tool for the right problem.
						2. The good framework of today is the bad framework of tomorrow. Don't get romantic.
						3. Always keep in mind what you are here for! Your mission is to "make a product that works so people can use it".
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Now with that said, let's look at a few "good" and "bad" reasons to use React.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Use cases

						There are some very good use cases that are valid for React:
						* I want to speed up the rendering of SOME components on my website
						* I have "many" elements on my page and I want to speed that up
						* I want to bring more dynamism to my website and I have "too much jQuery code"
						* I need a SPA or a Progressive App
						* I need an app on many platforms
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### Good reasons

						* If your jQuery starts to give you a headache and you can't find out a piece of code within 5 seconds > Spaghetti effect
						* If your need SPEED
						* If your current project has a lot of legacy code (AngularJS?) and you want to slowly retire it
						* If your project needs to be super smooth and you want either a SPA, a progressive web app, or just a great and fully controlled UX
						* If your front-end team is or will be big and require heavy collaboration
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### BAD reasons

						* If you use it just because a friend told you it was the best, you're probably doing it wrong (unless you're in the cases above)
						* If you think it's an overkill and just need something simpler. (However in that case you can just use React where it makes sense, see above)
						* If you just have some "tiny" level of interaction or need for dynamism, then just go jQuery... that's what it's for.

						React 4/4 - ReactNative!<br/>
						(cool stuff)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						First, installation of ReactNative is a big PITA. So you have to be patient.

						Full info here: [Install all the requirements](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						### What is it?

						ReactNative is a pretty cool initiative from FB (again) to build
						native apps with speed (of development) in mind.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Example:
						```
							import React, { Component } from 'react';
							import { AppRegistry, Text } from 'react-native';

							export default class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
								render() {
									return (
										<Text>Hello world!</Text>
									);
								}
							}
						```
